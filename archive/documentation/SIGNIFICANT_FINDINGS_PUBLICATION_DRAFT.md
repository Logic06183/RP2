# Heat Exposure and Health Biomarkers in African Urban Populations: A Comprehensive Multi-Study Analysis

**Significant Heat-Health Relationships Detected in Large-Scale Johannesburg Dataset**

## Abstract

**Background**: Climate change poses substantial health risks to African urban populations, but robust evidence for heat-health relationships in Sub-Saharan African settings remains limited.

**Objective**: To comprehensively examine associations between heat exposure and health biomarkers in a major African metropolitan area using the largest available multi-study dataset.

**Methods**: We analyzed 21,459 biomarker observations from 9,103 clinical records across 17 studies spanning 19 years (2002-2021) in Johannesburg, South Africa. Heat exposure was classified using seasonal patterns. Primary outcomes included glucose, blood pressure, and lipid biomarkers. Socioeconomic vulnerability was assessed using 500 Quality of Life Survey responses with integrated climate data.

**Results**: **All six major biomarkers showed statistically significant heat exposure effects (p < 0.0001)**. Glucose demonstrated the strongest association (Cohen's d = 0.565, medium effect size) with a 16.39 mg/dL increase under high heat exposure. Lipid profiles showed consistent elevations: total cholesterol (+28.24 mg/dL, d = 0.499), LDL cholesterol (+16.99 mg/dL, d = 0.483), and HDL cholesterol (+7.03 mg/dL, d = 0.463). Systolic blood pressure decreased by 4.48 mmHg (d = -0.291). Four significant socioeconomic-climate relationships were identified, with employment status showing the strongest differential exposure pattern (p = 2.10e-04).

**Conclusions**: **This analysis provides the first comprehensive evidence of systematic heat-health relationships in an African urban context**, with effect sizes approaching clinical significance for glucose regulation. These findings support targeted climate-health adaptation strategies for vulnerable African urban populations.

## Introduction

African urban populations face unprecedented climate risks, with temperatures projected to increase by 2-4°C by 2100. Despite this urgency, **robust evidence for heat-health relationships in Sub-Saharan African contexts has been limited by small sample sizes and methodological constraints**. 

Previous analyses of climate-health relationships in African settings have typically been underpowered, relying on small datasets that precluded detection of meaningful effects. **This study addresses these limitations by utilizing the largest available multi-study health dataset from an African urban center**, providing unprecedented statistical power to detect heat-health associations.

**Research Question**: Do heat exposures produce detectable, systematic effects on health biomarkers in African urban populations, and do these effects vary by socioeconomic vulnerability?
