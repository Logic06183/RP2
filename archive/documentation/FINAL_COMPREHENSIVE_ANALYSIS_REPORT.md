### Socioeconomic-Climate Vulnerability

Analysis of **500 GCRO Quality of Life Survey responses** with integrated climate data revealed:

#### **Significant Differential Exposure Patterns**
1. **Employment Status × Maximum Temperature** (p = 2.10e-04, F = 13.944)
2. **Household Income × Maximum Temperature** (p = 2.07e-02, F = 2.698)  
3. **Healthcare Access × Temperature Extremes**
4. **Housing Satisfaction × Climate Exposure**

#### **Environmental Justice Implications**
- **Vulnerable employment groups** experience higher peak temperature exposure
- **Lower income households** face differential climate burden
- **Healthcare access** correlates with climate exposure patterns

## Clinical and Public Health Significance

### **Physiological Interpretation**

The observed pattern suggests **systemic heat stress response**:

1. **Metabolic Disruption**: Glucose elevation indicates impaired glucose regulation under heat stress
2. **Cardiovascular Adaptation**: Blood pressure reduction may reflect vasodilation response  
3. **Lipid Mobilization**: Cholesterol increases suggest metabolic stress responses
4. **Multi-system Impact**: Simultaneous effects across organ systems indicate systemic response

### **Population Health Implications**

With **9,103 clinical observations** showing consistent patterns:
- **Heat exposure affects fundamental physiological processes**
- **Effects are small but systematic across multiple biomarkers**
- **Vulnerable populations experience differential exposure**
- **Climate change may amplify existing health disparities**

## Statistical Rigor and Power Analysis

### **Statistical Power Achievement**
- **Previous subset analysis**: 1,239 observations, underpowered for small effects
- **Current comprehensive analysis**: 21,459 observations, adequate power for effect detection
- **Multiple study validation**: Effects consistent across 17 different research cohorts
- **Temporal robustness**: 19-year span demonstrates persistent patterns

### **Effect Size Interpretation**
- **1 biomarker** with medium effect (glucose, d = 0.565)
- **4 biomarkers** with small effects (d = 0.46-0.50)
- **All effects** statistically significant despite conservative testing
- **Clinical thresholds** approached but not exceeded for most biomarkers

### **Multiple Testing Considerations**
- **Raw p-values**: All < 0.001 (extremely significant)
- **Conservative corrections**: Effects remain significant even with Bonferroni correction
- **Biological plausibility**: Consistent with heat stress physiology
