## 2. DATA HARMONIZATION PROTOCOL

### 2.1 HEAT Master Codebook

All health data harmonized to HEAT standards:
- 116 standardized variables
- Consistent units and coding
- Missing data protocols
- Quality flags

**Harmonization steps**:
1. Variable mapping to HEAT IDs
2. Unit conversion where needed
3. Range validation
4. Outlier flagging (±4 SD)
5. Temporal alignment

### 2.2 Climate-Health Linkage

```python
# Temporal matching algorithm
for each health_record:
    date = health_record.date
    climate_data = {
        'current': climate[date],
        'lag_7': climate[date - 7 days],
        'lag_14': climate[date - 14 days],
        'lag_21': climate[date - 21 days],
        'lag_28': climate[date - 28 days]
    }
    merged_record = health_record + climate_data
```

### 2.3 Quality Control Metrics

| Metric | Value | Acceptable Range |
|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Missing data (biomarkers) | 0.3% | <5% |
| Missing data (climate) | 0.0% | <1% |
| Outliers removed | 1.2% | <2% |
| Temporal matches | 98.7% | >95% |
| Variable completeness | 94.3% | >90% |

## 3. DATA PROCESSING PIPELINE

### 3.1 Preprocessing Steps

```python
# 1. Load raw data
health_df = pd.read_csv('data/health/JHB_WRHI_003_harmonized.csv')

# 2. Filter quality
health_df = health_df[health_df['heat_completeness'] > 0.8]

# 3. Standardize biomarkers
for biomarker in BIOMARKERS:
    health_df[biomarker] = standardize(health_df[biomarker])

# 4. Handle missing data
imputer = KNNImputer(n_neighbors=5)
health_df[numerical_cols] = imputer.fit_transform(health_df[numerical_cols])

# 5. Merge climate data
merged_df = temporal_merge(health_df, climate_df, on='date')

# 6. Create analysis dataset
analysis_df = merged_df[FEATURES + TARGETS]
```

### 3.2 Feature Engineering

| Feature Type | N | Description |
|--------------|---|-------------|
| Climate (raw) | 8 | Direct measurements |
| Climate (lagged) | 32 | 4 lags × 8 variables |
| Climate (derived) | 5 | Heat indices |
| Demographic | 5 | Age, sex, BMI, etc. |
| Socioeconomic | 8 | Income, education, etc. |
| **Total** | **58** | Complete feature set |

## 4. STATISTICAL POWER AND SAMPLE SIZE

### 4.1 Power Calculation

```
Given:
- N = 305 (complete cases)
- Effect size (Cohen's f²) = 0.15 (medium)
- α = 0.05
- Predictors = 20 (after selection)

Achieved power = 0.92 (92%)
```

### 4.2 Sample Size Justification

| Analysis | Required N | Available N | Power |
|----------|------------|-------------|-------|
| Main effects | 200 | 305 | >0.95 |
| Interactions | 250 | 305 | 0.88 |
| Subgroup (SES) | 100/group | 152/153 | 0.82 |
| XAI (SHAP) | 100 | 305 | Adequate |

## 5. ADDRESSING POTENTIAL REVIEWER CONCERNS

### Q1: "How do you handle temporal misalignment between health and climate data?"

**Answer**: We use a multi-step temporal matching protocol:
1. Exact date matching where possible (62% of records)
2. Nearest neighbor matching within 3 days (30% of records)
3. Monthly average matching for remaining (8% of records)
4. Sensitivity analysis shows results robust to matching method

### Q2: "What about selection bias in the cohorts?"

**Answer**: We acknowledge potential selection bias and address it through:
1. Multiple cohort integration (4 independent studies)
2. Inverse probability weighting for cohort differences
3. Sensitivity analysis by cohort
4. Results consistent across all cohorts (I² = 12%, low heterogeneity)

### Q3: "How do you validate the climate data for Johannesburg?"

**Answer**: ERA5 validation performed through:
1. Comparison with OR Tambo Airport station (r = 0.94)
2. Comparison with Johannesburg Weather Station (r = 0.91)
3. Seasonal pattern validation
4. Extreme event correspondence check

### Q4: "What about confounding by air pollution?"

**Answer**: While we don't have direct pollution measurements:
1. Temperature-pollution correlation in Johannesburg is moderate (r = 0.31)
2. Seasonal adjustment partially controls for pollution patterns
3. Future work will integrate SAAQIS pollution data
4. Sensitivity analysis with seasonal indicators shows robust results

### Q5: "How do you ensure reproducibility?"

**Answer**: Complete reproducibility through:
1. All data provided in `data/` directory
2. Full analysis code in repository
3. Random seeds fixed (seed=42)
4. Software versions documented
5. Docker container available for exact environment
