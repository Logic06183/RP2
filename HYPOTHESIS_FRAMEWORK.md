## Executive Summary

This document presents the comprehensive hypothesis framework for the DLNM-based climate-health analysis of Johannesburg, South Africa. The study examines longitudinal relationships between temperature exposure and health outcomes across cardiovascular and renal pathways, with particular attention to socioeconomic vulnerability interactions and distributed lag effects.

**Key Innovation**: Application of Distributed Lag Non-linear Models (DLNM) to African urban climate-health data with explicit focus on environmental justice implications.

## 1. Primary Research Hypotheses

### H1: Temperature-Health Dose-Response Relationships

**Primary Hypothesis**: Temperature exposure exhibits non-linear, dose-response relationships with health outcomes, with effects varying by physiological pathway.

**Sub-hypotheses**:
- H1a: **Cardiovascular pathway** shows moderate sensitivity to temperature with effects beginning above 25°C
- H1b: **Renal pathway** shows stronger sensitivity with effects beginning above 22°C  
- H1c: Temperature-health relationships follow **non-linear patterns** with acceleration at extreme temperatures

**Biological Rationale**:
- Cardiovascular: Heat stress triggers vasodilation, increased cardiac output, and inflammatory responses
- Renal: Heat exposure leads to dehydration, reduced kidney perfusion, and electrolyte imbalances
- Non-linearity: Physiological compensation mechanisms overwhelmed at temperature thresholds

**Statistical Framework**: DLNM with natural cubic splines, knots at 10th, 25th, and 90th percentiles

---

### H2: Distributed Lag Effects

**Primary Hypothesis**: Temperature effects on health outcomes are distributed across multiple lag periods, with pattern variation by pathway.

**Sub-hypotheses**:
- H2a: **Acute effects** (0-3 days) strongest for cardiovascular outcomes
- H2b: **Delayed effects** (7-21 days) strongest for renal outcomes
- H2c: **Cumulative effects** over 21-day periods exceed single-day effects

**Physiological Rationale**:
- Acute cardiovascular responses to heat stress (immediate autonomic responses)
- Delayed renal responses due to cumulative dehydration and metabolic stress
- Temporal clustering of health events following extreme weather

**Statistical Framework**: Cross-basis functions with lag dimension up to 21 days, natural cubic splines for lag structure

---

### H3: Socioeconomic Effect Modification

**Primary Hypothesis**: Socioeconomic vulnerability modifies temperature-health relationships through differential exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity.

**Sub-hypotheses**:
- H3a: **Higher vulnerability** populations show stronger temperature-health associations
- H3b: **Income effects** modify relationships through housing quality and cooling access
- H3c: **Education effects** modify relationships through health behaviors and awareness

**Environmental Justice Framework**:
- Differential vulnerability: Unequal distribution of climate health impacts
- Structural factors: Income, education, housing quality as effect modifiers
- Adaptive capacity: Resources available for heat adaptation strategies

**Statistical Framework**: Interaction terms, stratified analysis by SES tertiles, vulnerability index construction

---

## 2. Secondary Research Hypotheses

### H4: Seasonal Vulnerability Patterns

**Hypothesis**: Health vulnerability to temperature varies seasonally, with greatest sensitivity during transition periods.

**Rationale**: Physiological acclimatization varies seasonally, with reduced adaptation during rapid temperature changes.

### H5: Urban Heat Island Effects

**Hypothesis**: Urban microclimate variations create differential temperature-health relationships across Johannesburg neighborhoods.

**Rationale**: Built environment influences local temperature exposure and cooling access.

### H6: Threshold Temperature Effects

**Hypothesis**: Distinct temperature thresholds exist above which health effects accelerate non-linearly.

**Framework**: 
- 75th percentile: Early warning threshold
- 90th percentile: Public health action threshold  
- 95th percentile: Emergency response threshold

---

## 3. Methodological Hypotheses

### H7: DLNM Superior Performance

**Hypothesis**: DLNM approaches outperform conventional time-series methods for capturing climate-health relationships.

**Comparison Framework**:
- DLNM vs. traditional lag models
- Non-linear vs. linear temperature functions
- Distributed vs. single-lag approaches

### H8: Machine Learning Enhancement

**Hypothesis**: Machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) capture complex temperature-health interactions better than linear models.

**Framework**: Model comparison across multiple algorithms with rigorous cross-validation

## 4. Statistical Analysis Framework

### 4.1 DLNM Model Specification

```r
# Primary DLNM models
cardiovascular_model <- gam(
  cardio_score ~ cb_temp + 
    s(day_of_year, bs="cc", k=8) +  # Seasonal smooth
    factor(year) +                   # Year effects
    ses_vulnerability +              # SES adjustment
    offset(log(1 + cardio_score * 0.01)),
  family = gaussian(),
  data = analysis_data
)

renal_model <- gam(
  renal_risk ~ cb_temp + 
    s(day_of_year, bs="cc", k=8) +  # Seasonal smooth
    factor(year) +                   # Year effects
    ses_vulnerability,               # SES adjustment
  family = binomial(),
  data = analysis_data
)
```

### 4.2 Cross-basis Construction

**Temperature Dimension**: Natural cubic splines with knots at:
- 10th percentile: 17.95°C
- 25th percentile: 19.71°C  
- 90th percentile: 21.51°C

**Lag Dimension**: Natural cubic splines with 4 degrees of freedom over 0-21 days

### 4.3 Effect Estimation

**Relative Risk Calculation**:
```r
# Temperature-response curves
temp_effects <- crosspred(cb_temp, model, at=temp_grid, cumul=TRUE)

# Lag-response patterns  
lag_effects <- crosspred(cb_temp, model, at=extreme_temp, bylag=0.25)
```
